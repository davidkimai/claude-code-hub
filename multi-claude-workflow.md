# Multi-Claude Workflows: Advanced Techniques and Patterns

Working with multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously can dramatically improve your productivity and effectiveness for complex tasks. This guide explores advanced techniques for multi-Claude workflows, with practical examples and implementation strategies.

## Why Use Multiple Claude Instances?

Running multiple Claude Code instances offers several advantages:

- **Separation of concerns**: Each Claude can focus on a specific aspect of a complex task
- **Parallelization**: Work on multiple tasks simultaneously
- **Specialization**: Each Claude can be given different context and expertise
- **Cross-validation**: One Claude can review another's work
- **Context management**: Overcome context window limitations

## Setup Options for Multi-Claude Workflows

### 1. Multiple Terminal Windows

The simplest approach is to run Claude Code in multiple terminal windows or tabs:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Code writer
cd ~/projects/myapp
claude

# Terminal 2 - Test writer
cd ~/projects/myapp
claude

# Terminal 3 - Code reviewer
cd ~/projects/myapp
claude
```

### 2. Git Worktrees

Git worktrees provide a lightweight way to check out multiple branches from the same repository in different directories:

```bash
# Create worktrees for different tasks
git worktree add ../myapp-feature-a feature-a
git worktree add ../myapp-feature-b feature-b
git worktree add ../myapp-tests tests

# Run Claude in each worktree
cd ../myapp-feature-a && claude &
cd ../myapp-feature-b && claude &
cd ../myapp-tests && claude &
```

### 3. Multiple Project Checkouts

For completely isolated environments, you can clone your repository multiple times:

```bash
# Clone repository multiple times
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myapp.git myapp-dev
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myapp.git myapp-docs
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myapp.git myapp-tests

# Run Claude in each checkout
cd myapp-dev && claude &
cd myapp-docs && claude &
cd myapp-tests && claude &
```

### 4. Docker Containers

For maximum isolation, use Docker containers:

```bash
# Run Claude in separate containers
docker run -it -v ~/projects/myapp:/app claude-code-dev
docker run -it -v ~/projects/myapp:/app claude-code-tests
docker run -it -v ~/projects/myapp:/app claude-code-review
```

## Common Multi-Claude Patterns

### 1. Write/Test Pattern

Assign one Claude to write code and another to write tests:

#### Claude 1 (Writer):
```
> Implement a user authentication system with login, logout, and registration functions
```

#### Claude 2 (Tester):
```
> Write comprehensive tests for the user authentication system that Claude 1 is implementing
```

#### Benefits:
- Parallel development of code and tests
- Better test coverage as the test writer is independent
- Closer to test-driven development practices

### 2. Implementation/Review Pattern

One Claude implements while another reviews the implementation:

#### Claude 1 (Implementer):
```
> Develop a caching layer for our database queries to improve performance
```

#### Claude 2 (Reviewer):
```
> Review the caching implementation that Claude 1 created, focusing on correctness, performance, and best practices
```

#### Benefits:
- Immediate feedback on implementation
- Catches issues early in the development process
- Provides multiple perspectives on the same code

### 3. Research/Implement Pattern

One Claude researches approaches while another implements:

#### Claude 1 (Researcher):
```
> Research the best approaches for implementing real-time notifications using WebSockets
```

#### Claude 2 (Implementer):
```
> Implement real-time notifications using the WebSocket approach that Claude 1 recommended
```

#### Benefits:
- More thorough exploration of solutions
- Implementation based on well-researched options
- Division of exploratory and implementation tasks

### 4. Specialized Agents Pattern

Each Claude specializes in a different layer or component:

#### Claude 1 (Frontend):
```
> Create the React components for the user dashboard
```

#### Claude 2 (Backend):
```
> Implement the API endpoints needed for the user dashboard
```

#### Claude 3 (Database):
```
> Design and implement the database schema for storing user dashboard data
```

#### Benefits:
- Specialized focus on each architectural layer
- Parallel development of dependent components
- Each Claude can have specialized context in its CLAUDE.md

### 5. Divide and Conquer Pattern

Break a large task into smaller pieces, with one Claude per piece:

#### Claude 1:
```
> Implement the user authentication module of our application
```

#### Claude 2:
```
> Implement the data visualization module of our application
```

#### Claude 3:
```
> Implement the notification system of our application
```

#### Benefits:
- Parallel development of multiple features
- Each Claude has a manageable scope
- Faster overall development time

## Communication Between Claude Instances

For Claude instances to work together effectively, they need ways to share information:

### 1. Shared Files

Create files that multiple Claude instances can read and write:

#### Claude 1:
```
> Analyze the performance bottlenecks in our application and write your findings to performance_analysis.md
```

#### Claude 2:
```
> Read performance_analysis.md and implement the recommended optimizations
```

### 2. Git Branches and Commits

Use git to share code between Claude instances:

#### Claude 1:
```
> Implement the user authentication API and commit it to the auth-api branch
```

#### Claude 2:
```
> Check out the auth-api branch, review the code, and implement the frontend components that use this API
```

### 3. GitHub Issues and PRs

Use GitHub's collaboration features:

#### Claude 1:
```
> Create a GitHub issue detailing the requirements for the notification system
```

#### Claude 2:
```
> Implement the notification system based on the requirements in issue #42, then create a pull request
```

#### Claude 3:
```
> Review the pull request for the notification system and suggest improvements
```

### 4. Scratchpad Files

Use temporary files as scratchpads for communication:

#### Claude 1:
```
> Research the best libraries for data visualization and write your findings to viz_research.txt
```

#### Claude 2:
```
> Read viz_research.txt and create a comparison table of the top 3 libraries
```

## Advanced Multi-Claude Coordination

### Orchestration Scripts

Create scripts to coordinate multiple Claude instances:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# orchestrate.sh - Coordinate multiple Claude instances

# Start Claude 1 - Frontend
cd frontend
claude -p "Implement the login page according to the design in mockups/login.png" --dangerously-skip-permissions &
CLAUDE1_PID=$!

# Start Claude 2 - Backend
cd ../backend
claude -p "Implement the authentication API endpoints" --dangerously-skip-permissions &
CLAUDE2_PID=$!

# Wait for both to complete
wait $CLAUDE1_PID
wait $CLAUDE2_PID

# Start Claude 3 - Integration
cd ..
claude -p "Review the frontend and backend implementation and ensure they work together correctly" --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### Pipeline Pattern

Create a pipeline of Claude instances where the output of one feeds into the next:

```bash
# Start a pipeline of Claude instances
claude -p "Analyze requirements in requirements.txt" --output requirements_analysis.md
claude -p "Design system architecture based on requirements_analysis.md" --output architecture_design.md
claude -p "Create implementation plan based on architecture_design.md" --output implementation_plan.md
claude -p "Implement core components according to implementation_plan.md"
```

This pattern works especially well for complex, multi-stage projects where each step builds on the previous one.

### Event-Driven Coordination

Use file watchers to trigger Claude instances when files change:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# watch-and-react.sh

# Watch for changes to the API implementation
fswatch -o backend/api/ | while read f; do
  echo "API changes detected, running tests and documentation update"
  claude -p "Run tests for the updated API endpoints" --allowedTools "Bash(npm run test:api)" &
  claude -p "Update API documentation based on changes" --allowedTools "Edit" &
done
```

### Notification System

Create a simple notification system to alert you when Claude instances need attention:

```bash
# In Claude 1's CLAUDE.md
# Notification Commands
- `notify "Message"`: Send a notification to the user
```

```python
# notify.py - A simple notification script
import sys
import os
from datetime import datetime

def notify(message, claude_instance):
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")
    with open("claude_notifications.log", "a") as f:
        f.write(f"[{timestamp}] Claude {claude_instance}: {message}\n")
    
    # Desktop notification (macOS)
    if sys.platform == "darwin":
        os.system(f'osascript -e \'display notification "{message}" with title "Claude {claude_instance}"\' &')
    # Desktop notification (Linux)
    elif sys.platform.startswith("linux"):
        os.system(f'notify-send "Claude {claude_instance}" "{message}" &')
    # Desktop notification (Windows)
    elif sys.platform == "win32":
        os.system(f'powershell -command "[void] [System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName(\'System.Windows.Forms\'); [void] [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]::Show(\'{message}\', \'Claude {claude_instance}\')" &')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Usage: python notify.py <message> <claude_instance>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    message = sys.argv[1]
    claude_instance = sys.argv[2]
    notify(message, claude_instance)
```

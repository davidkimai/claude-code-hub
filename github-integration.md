This guide continues our exploration of Git and GitHub integration with Claude Code, focusing specifically on integrating version control into your development workflows. Whether you're a solo developer or part of a large team, these strategies will help you leverage Claude Code's capabilities to enhance your Git-based development process.

## Integration with Development Workflows

### CI/CD Integration

Claude Code can help you integrate Git with your CI/CD pipelines:

```
> Help me set up a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests on every push
```

Claude will create a workflow file like:

```yaml
name: Run Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 16
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

Claude can also help with more complex CI/CD setups:

```
> Create a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys our application
```

Claude will guide you through creating a comprehensive pipeline with stages for:
- Building the application
- Running different types of tests
- Deploying to staging and production environments
- Notifying team members of results

### Code Review Automation

Claude can enhance your code review process:

```
> Set up automated code reviews for our pull requests
```

Claude will help you implement automated checks like:

1. Linting and code style verification
2. Test coverage requirements
3. Performance regression detection
4. Security vulnerability scanning
5. Documentation completeness checks

Example of setting up a PR template with Claude:

```
> Create a pull request template that ensures reviewers check for security, performance, and accessibility
```

Claude will generate a template like:

```markdown
## Description
[Describe the changes and their purpose]

## Type of change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests have been added/updated
- [ ] Documentation has been updated
- [ ] Security considerations have been addressed
- [ ] Performance impact has been evaluated
- [ ] Accessibility requirements have been met

## Security considerations
[Detail any security implications of these changes]

[Describe how these changes affect application performance]

## Accessibility considerations
[Explain how these changes maintain or improve accessibility]
```

### Release Management

Claude can streamline your release process:

```
> Guide me through creating a release with semantic versioning
```

Claude will provide a step-by-step workflow:

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on the main branch
git checkout main
git pull

# 2. Update version in package.json
# (Claude can help you edit this file)

# 3. Generate a changelog
# (Claude can help create this from commit history)

# 4. Commit version bump and changelog
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: release v1.2.0"

# 5. Create and push a git tag
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0

# 6. Create a GitHub release
# (Claude can help you use the GitHub CLI for this)
```

Claude can also help you automate this process:

```
> Create a release script that automates our versioning, changelog generation, and release creation
```

Claude will generate a shell script or Node.js script that handles the entire release process.

## Git-Based Project Management

### Issue-Branch Workflows

Claude can help you implement an issue-branch workflow:

```
> Help me set up a workflow where each issue gets its own branch
```

Claude will suggest a process like:

1. Create an issue in GitHub
2. Create a branch named after the issue (e.g., `issue-42-fix-login-bug`)
3. Make changes and commit them
4. Create a pull request referencing the issue
5. Close the issue when the PR is merged

Claude can even help automate this:

```
> Create a script that automatically creates a branch for a given issue number
```

Claude will generate a script like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# create-issue-branch.sh

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: ./create-issue-branch.sh <issue-number>"
  exit 1
fi

ISSUE_NUM=$1

# Fetch issue title from GitHub
ISSUE_TITLE=$(gh issue view $ISSUE_NUM --json title -q .title | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-' | tr -cd '[:alnum:]-')

# Create branch
BRANCH_NAME="issue-$ISSUE_NUM-$ISSUE_TITLE"
git checkout -b $BRANCH_NAME

echo "Created branch: $BRANCH_NAME"
echo "Based on issue #$ISSUE_NUM"
```

### Project Board Integration

Claude can help you integrate Git with project boards:

```
> Show me how to automatically move issues to "In Progress" when a branch is created
```

Claude will explain how to set up GitHub Actions workflows that update project boards based on Git events:

```yaml
name: Update Project Board

on:
  create:
    branches:
      - 'issue-*'

jobs:
  update_project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Extract issue number
        id: extract
        run: |
          BRANCH_NAME=${{ github.ref_name }}
          ISSUE_NUM=$(echo $BRANCH_NAME | grep -o 'issue-[0-9]*' | cut -d'-' -f2)
          echo "issue_number=$ISSUE_NUM" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      
      - name: Move issue to In Progress
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          script: |
            const issueNumber = ${{ steps.extract.outputs.issue_number }};
            
            // Get project details
            const projects = await github.rest.projects.listForRepo({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo
            });
            
            // Update project card
            // (Specific implementation depends on whether you're using classic projects or new project tables)
```

```javascript
// Feature flag configuration
const FEATURES = {
  NEW_USER_PROFILE: process.env.ENABLE_NEW_USER_PROFILE === 'true',
  ENHANCED_SEARCH: process.env.ENABLE_ENHANCED_SEARCH === 'true',
  DARK_MODE: process.env.ENABLE_DARK_MODE === 'true'
};

// Usage in code
function renderUserProfile(user) {
  if (FEATURES.NEW_USER_PROFILE) {
    return <NewUserProfile user={user} />;
  } else {
    return <LegacyUserProfile user={user} />;
  }
}
```

echo "Git Activity Analysis ($START_DATE to $END_DATE)"
echo "================================================"

# Total commits
TOTAL_COMMITS=$(git log --since="$START_DATE" --until="$END_DATE" --oneline | wc -l)
echo "Total commits: $TOTAL_COMMITS"

# Commits per author
echo -e "\nCommits per author:"
git shortlog -sn --since="$START_DATE" --until="$END_DATE"

# Average commits per day
DAYS=$(( ($(date -d "$END_DATE" +%s) - $(date -d "$START_DATE" +%s)) / 86400 ))
echo -e "\nAverage commits per day: $(echo "scale=2; $TOTAL_COMMITS / $DAYS" | bc)"

# Files changed
echo -e "\nMost frequently changed files:"
git log --since="$START_DATE" --until="$END_DATE" --name-only --pretty=format:"" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

# Branches created
echo -e "\nBranches created in period:"
git for-each-ref --sort=creatordate --format '%(creatordate:short) %(refname:short)' refs/heads/ | grep -E "^($START_DATE|$END_DATE|2023)"

# PR statistics (requires GitHub CLI)
if command -v gh &> /dev/null; then
  echo -e "\nPull Request statistics:"
  gh pr list --state all --search "created:$START_DATE..$END_DATE" --json number,state,closedAt,createdAt | \
    jq 'length as $total | map(select(.state == "MERGED")) | length as $merged | "Total PRs: \($total)\nMerged PRs: \($merged)\nMerge rate: \(($merged/$total*100)|round)%"'
